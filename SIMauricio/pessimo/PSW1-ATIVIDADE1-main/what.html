        <h2>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.
            by Subject
            A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.
            by Type
            Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.
            If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: About the W3 project.
